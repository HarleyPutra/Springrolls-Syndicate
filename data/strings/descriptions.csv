springrollssyndicate,FACTION,"The Springrolls-Syndicate originated as a successful Asian food company during the Domain Era. Thriving in the culinary industry, their fortunes took a hit when the AI War erupted. With supply chains disrupted, the once-prosperous business faced dire challenges. Adapting to the war, they conducted research to bolster their economy and transformed civilian-grade ships into war machines.

Amidst the conflict, the Springrolls-Syndicate embarked on an experiment to explore the uncharted ocean world of Bekasi I, seeking unique ingredients to sustain their business. Unbeknownst to them, the ocean world harbored mesmerizing bioluminescent algae with extraordinary flavor-enhancing properties.

As they harvested and experimented with the algae, unforeseen events unfolded. In their haste and under the pressure of the AI wars, the Springrolls-Syndicate botched a massive operation to transport the experimental flavor enhancer to the core systems using their colossus-class superfreighters. A hegemony strike group mistook the superfreighters for weapon transports, leading to the colossal ships crashing down on the planet now known as Gourmettopolis.",,,,,,,

springsyn_masaki_carry,SHIP,"Loved by the local populace, the Masaki Carry was first produced during the height of the Springrolls-Syndicate during the domain era and was the backbone of logistics for the Springrolls-Syndicate. Modified to be able to perform space travel, the Masaki Carry was adopted into the Syndicate's Logistics for it's low maintenance, and the ability to evade enemy strike fleets using it's small profile and oversized engine ensuring the cargo's safety. Springrolls-Syndicate's residents say they have seen experimental variants of the hull around Springrolls-Syndicate's strike groups.",,,,,,,
springsyn_masaki_fuelrunner,SHIP,"In response to escalating tensions among factions, a fuel tanker variant of the Masaki Carry, known as the Masaki Fuelrunner, was developed. Designed to navigate around patrols, the Masaki Fuelrunner is equipped with three fuel tanks. The Masaki Fuelrunner works in tandem with the Masaki Carry, extending the maximum travel range of the Springrolls-Syndicate logistics fleet detachments from their capital ships. By aiding in the transportation of goods to various black markets in enemy territories, the Masaki Fuelrunner played a crucial role in sustaining the Springrolls-Syndicate's economy during the AI wars.",,,,,,,
